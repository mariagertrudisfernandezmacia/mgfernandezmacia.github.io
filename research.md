<h5 style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0;">Labour Market Conditions at Arrival and the Integration of Migrants</h5>

<p style="font-size: smaller; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 0;">In this paper, I study how conditions of the labour market at arrival affect the subsequent economic success of migrants and refugees. To do so, I use several rounds of the UK Labour Force Survey covering immigrants arrived in the UK between 2001 and 2016. In the empirical strategy, I exploit the quasi-random allocation of asylum seekers due to the Dispersal Policy effective since 2001. Because refugee status is not reported in the UKLFS, I identify it by combining information on their country of origin and year of arrival with yearly acceptance rates by origin country provided by the UK Home Office. For refugees, I estimated that a high unemployment rate at arrival is associated with lower earnings, an effect that lasts up to 3-4 years after arrival. In particular, refugees experience up to a 10% decrease in earnings for each percentage point increase in the unemployment rate at arrival.</p>
